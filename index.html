<div class="body">
  OSCAR (OpenStack Configurator for Academic Research) is an open source software for building a research vDC (Virtual Data Center) on top of hardware or a cloud. OSCAR vDC provides complete control to user giving ‘em a lot more to explore and research on OpenStack cloud. OSCAR can also be used to build a scalable Private Cloud. 

<br>
  The OSCAR project is designed to simlify OpenStack installation process for building cloud based research vDC (virtual data center). This project has scripts to configre the computing resources and prepare them for OpenStack deployment using OpenStack-Ansible, an official OpenStack project. This package also pulls stable version of the OpenStack-Ansible from github and prepares the configuration files to match the environment.

  <br>
  OSCAR can also be used to deploy a private cloud on top of Chameleon Cloud BareMetal nodes. With a couple of simple additional commands the private cloud can be configured to have public access. OSCAR offers two different deployment options, step by step installation for beginners to understand the architectural components of Openstack cloud and a one step installation for researchers who wants to deploy a private cloud for performining cutting edge research on Openstack and topics associated with it.
