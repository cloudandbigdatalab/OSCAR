# OSCAR
###OpenStack Configurator for Academic Research (OSCAR)
The way academia deploys OpenStack for Research.

Please find the full documentation of the project at http://cloudandbigdatalab.github.io/OSCAR/

The OSCAR project is designed to simplify OpenStack installation process for building cloud based research computing testbeds. This project has scripts to configure the computing resources and prepare them for OpenStack deployment using OpenStack-Ansible, an official OpenStack project. This package also pulls stable version of the OpenStack-Ansible from github and prepares the configuration files to match the environment.

OSCAR can also be used to deploy a private cloud on top of Chameleon Cloud Bare-Metal nodes. With a couple of simple additional commands the private cloud can be configured to have public access. OSCAR offers two different deployment options, step by step installation for beginners to understand the architectural components of OpenStack cloud and a one step installation for researchers who wants to deploy a private cloud for performining cutting edge research on OpenStack and topics associated with it.
